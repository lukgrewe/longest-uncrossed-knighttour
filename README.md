# Longest Uncrossed Knighttour
The longest uncrossed (or nonintersecting) knight's path is a mathematical problem involving a knight on the standard 8×8 chessboard or, more generally, on a square n×n board. The problem is to find the longest path the knight can take on the given board, such that the path does not intersect itself. A further distinction can be made between a closed path, which ends on the same field as where it begins, and an open path, which ends on a different field from where it begins.
